## 🔪 Instructions

1. **Preheat the oven**  
   - Set the oven to **200°C (400°F)**.  
   - Line a muffin tin with paper cases or lightly grease it.

2. **Mix dry ingredients**  
   - In a large bowl, combine **flour**, **baking powder**, **sugar**, and **salt**.

3. **Mix wet ingredients**  
   - In a separate bowl, whisk together **egg**, **milk**, **melted butter**, and **vanilla extract**.

4. **Combine ingredients**  
   - Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet mixture.  
   - Stir gently until just combined — the batter should be slightly lumpy.  
   - Fold in any optional add-ins like **blueberries** or **chocolate chips**.  
   - **Do not overmix**, or muffins will be tough.

5. **Fill the muffin tin**  
   - Spoon the batter into the prepared tin, filling each cup about **2/3 full**.

6. **Bake**  
   - Bake for **20–25 minutes**, until the muffins are golden and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.

7. **Cool and serve**  
   - Let the muffins cool for a few minutes in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack.  
   - Serve warm or at room temperature.
